# Intro

This is a special fork of MonoGame 2.0 targeting devices running OpenGL ES 2.0 and desktop
operating system (Windows/Linux).

My main interest were to get MonoGame working on Raspberry PI device.

# State of development

Tetris and some other MonoGame samples are running smoothly on Windows + GLES 2.0 simulated
drivers :)

Tons of "unported" stuff, for example in Graphics/Effects

# Tetris on Windows 7

1. Get MonoDevelop (3.0.3.5 tested)
2. git MonoGame (https://github.com/noxo/MonoGame)
3. git OpenTK (https://github.com/mono/opentk)
4. git Tetris (https://github.com/CartBlanche/MonoGame-Samples)
5. Install OpenGL ES 2.0 emulator (http://www.malideveloper.com/opengl-es-20-emulator.php)

Compile & Run :)
